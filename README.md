# UserStories Using React


User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature (user requirements or expectations)  told from any stakeholder like user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:

As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.

User stories are often written on index cards or sticky notes, stored in a shoe box, and arranged on walls or tables to facilitate planning and discussion. As such, they strongly shift the focus from writing about features to discussing them. In fact, these discussions are more important than whatever text is written.

In this project, we will give a small website to ducement the user stories. This can be used for any project.
